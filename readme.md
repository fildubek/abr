â€‹A Simple game that is made entirely from code only. No external graphics files not external sound files. Graphics are drawn sounds are generated.

Try to find and decode the weakness on the enemy robot, then choose the correct missile to attack.

This is part of my personal challenge to create a simple game and the create variations of the game in different Programming Languages/Dialects.

This Version is made with Javascript+Html+Css

Each version will be different and unique but will have similar gamaplay.

next version I will see what c can do.
